        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p id="about-me">I have always been interested in the process of coding. From creating experiences out of code with video games, to making highly functional and detail oriented services,
        coding has always peaked an interest for me. This interest grew into passion for me as I grew up, and I am now pursuing a two year long software development diploma at SAIT.
        Coming into my second year in my diploma program, I have covered and learned many functionalities and programming languages. I am efficient in Python, C#, HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, and SQL. I am currently 
        learning NodeJS and more of jQuery. I am very interested in making custom websites and also getting into the path of video game development. However, every field of programming and coding greatly sparks my interest.
        I am striving to find an internship in the coming Spring/Summer semester. I would love to consider any sort of position or oppurtunity that can teach me life long skills in any field of programming or coding.
